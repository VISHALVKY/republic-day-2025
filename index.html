      <h1>Republic Day: A Celebration of India’s Sovereignty</h1>
      <p>Republic Day, celebrated on <span class="highlight">January 26 each year,</span> is one of India’s most significant national holidays. It marks the day in 1950 when the <span class="highlight">Constitution of India</span> came into effect, transforming the country into a sovereign, democratic, and secular republic. 
        This day reflects the nation’s commitment to uphold the values of <span class="highlight">justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity</span> enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
      <h1>The Historical Significance of Republic Day</h1>
      <p>The date, January 26, holds <span class="highlight">special importance</span> in India’s struggle for independence. It was on this day in 1930 that the Indian National Congress declared <span class="highlight">Purna Swaraj</span> (Complete Independence) at the Lahore Session. 
        Choosing this date to enforce the Constitution in 1950 was a tribute to the vision of an independent and self-reliant India.</p>
    <p>The drafting of the Indian Constitution began in 1946 and was completed on November 26, 1949. Under the leadership of <span class="highlight">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</span>, the drafting committee worked tirelessly to create a document that would govern the world’s largest democracy. 
       On January 26, 1950, this Constitution replaced the Government of India Act (1935), making India a <span class="highlight">republic</span>.</p>
